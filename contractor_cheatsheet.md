# Contractor Cheatsheet

Welcome! You’re about to become a Viper Developer!

## General Terms

Once you get paid the work is owned by Viper Development UG (and then eventually the client). You’ll retain your copyright because that can’t be taken away and nobody wants to anyway :) You can get paid anytime for any hours that you did even if the client didn't pay me, that's not your problem.

Payment is in Euros as it's a very common currency and happens to be mine. Any conversion fees especially to less common currencies are on you, the contractor. As such I advise to use services like [Transferwise](https://transferwise.com) for the money transfer, that’ll give you almost no payment fees. (Effectively it's in the hand of the party with the less common currency to use the most efficient payment gateway.)

**If you don’t use transferwise, you might LOOSE ~40EUR ON A 100EUR TRANSACTION. You are warned. All banks involved in an international transfer are unbelievably greedy.** Don’t do that except you’re in EUR and Europe, then it’s free.

## Working Times

You work whenever you want I have no desire to control you in any capacity. If you don't want to work on something anymore that's fine anytime of course but it'd be nice if you tell me :)

## How your Bill Should Look Like

Ask Lasse for a freshbooks account. You can (but don’t have to) use Freshbooks.

**YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR FRESHBOOKS NOR ENTER A TRIAL!** They’ll show ads but you can click them away. I pay for this already.

TODO, we might migrate from freshbooks so this will be redone at some point.

At the top there has to be YOUR name and address, not viperdev or anything. Freshbooks might do this wrong by default.
Second thing on there on the left should be:

```
Viper Development UG (haftungsbeschränkt)
Haakestrasse 37
Hamburg Hamburg  21075 
VAT ID will be provided later
```

Be sure to put payment instructions on the bill, e.g. a link to transferwise or your bank account data!

## I want to learn stuff that is relevant for Viper Development!

Just ask Lasse for educational budget. You will be expected to write a document like this and you will be paid for your time spending on an online course.

Only do this if you intend to work with us for a longer period, this is an investment in you and we’re happy to do it but as a business we can’t pay you randomly for things that’s not useful for us :/

If you’ve worked with us for a longer time it’s also possible to get you to your favourite conference or so, we’ll work something out :)

## I need XXX to do my job!

Need a development license for apple or anything? It depends on the project you’re working on if it pays off for Viper Development to fund that for you but generally things up to 100eur or so are not a problem at all. Just talk to Lasse :)

Once approved you can just buy it in the name of your business, upload the expense to freshbooks and freshbooks will allow you to rebill it to me directly.

## Freshbooks - mark an invoice as paid

After you receive the money from Viper Development, please mark the invoice as paid.

To do that go to Invoices > Payments > Add new payment for the bill.
